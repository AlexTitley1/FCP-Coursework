This is my submission for the FCP assignment 5.
Task 1

Task 2
This script implements the Deffuant model of opinion dynamics, where each individual (or "agent") within a closed group updates their opinion through pairwise interactions. The model allows interactions only if the opinions of the agents are within a certain threshold of each other. The strength of the opinion shift during interactions is governed by a coupling constant, beta. To run the simulation, execute the script from the command line. You can test different parameters by modifying the test_defuant function within the script.
The script generates two plots:
A scatter plot showing the evolution of opinions for each time step.
A histogram showing the final distribution of opinions.
